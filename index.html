				<p>This Barangay was founded in 1969 and its name was taken from the tall and beautiful endemic Lawa-an trees that were plentiful. It was said that when our forefathers came to Cebu, this place was full of vegetation and its lush forest extended up to the area of Manipis. The red and white Lawa-an species were in abundance.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="one-half">
				<p>Barangay Lawa-an II is bounded by Barangay Lawa-an III on the North, Barangay San Isidro on the East, Barangay Mohon on the South, and Barangay Lawa-an I on the West. It has a land area of 72.251 hectares with eighteen (18) Sitios. The Barangay belongs to the middle-income class of the City of Talisay, Cebu. </p>

			<p>A 14-year old girl was rescued by the team of barangay officials from Lawaan II. The barangay officials who led the rescue were Barangay Chair Buenaventura R. Pelonio, Barangay Councilor Jackie Sarona who heads the Committee of Women and Children and also a trained Para Social Worker and Joan Cabalda, barangay secretary.</p>

			<p>A girl accompanied by a former trafficked victim reported to the barangay that her 14-year-old younger sister has been in the hands of a gay suspect. According to the former trafficked victim, the suspect was recruiting young girls by promising that they will earn lots of money if they will join. After they recruitment, the girls are forced to take drugs and then used for prostitution. In line with the protocol of reporting, the barangay officials immediately informed the City Social Welfare and Development Office (CSWDO) and Philippine National Police (PNP) about the report, the description and the hideout of the suspect. The report coincided with the description of the suspect and the area already under surveillance by the PNP and the Children’s Legal Bureau, Inc. (CLB).</p>

			<p>Because of the appeal of the victim’s older sister who was worrying her health and safety, they immediately rescued her using the barangay vehicle without waiting for the PNP. A successful rescue was done at 12 midnight, after which, they immediately brought the girl to the CSWDO who referred her to a temporary shelter in Cebu City managed by DSWD Region VII. The girl was found to already be infected with STD and currently under medical treatment.</p>

			<p>The three barangay officials realized that they can do something in their capacity to stop or prevent possible child trafficking and planned to involve all their barangay councilors and community watch groups to monitor their respective sitios. They also plan to organize their young people for continuing information drive.</p>
